			<p>Via <a href="http://glossolaliarecords.bandcamp.com" target="blank"s>Glossolalia Records</a>,</p>
			<p><i>"An album nearly three years in the making, this is Banewreaker's debut disc of antipathy and dismissal. Rising from the ashes of the second iteration of Willamette Valley hardcore experimentalists Aeolus, Banewreaker is comprised of current and former members of Grst, LORD and Arkhum. A vicious convolution of American black metal and contemporary hardcore, Banewreaker represents a new and solitary vision for the Glossolalian regiment."</i></p>
			<p>This was an enjoyable and very hands-on project as it was one of the few recent instances where I've had the intent and opportunity not just to direct a package layout, but also to craft the end product myself (with extra hands on deck for screenprinting and assemblage courtesy of the band).</p>
			<p>For the artwork, medieval woodcuts were selected from the public domain for content that aligned with the lyrical themes on the album. These were then screenprinted via handpull to recycled cardboard sleeves for the discs themselves, and canvass fabric for accompanying back and arm patches. The disctop art was designed to match and, being applied to the discs by the manufacturer, was the only element not crafted by hand.</p>
