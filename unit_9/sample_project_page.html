			<p>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center launched their new walk event, Boot Walk to End Cancer, in May. This new walk is a community initiative where all proceeds from the event will benefit research and patient programs at MD Anderson, home to the nation’s top-ranked hospital for cancer care.</p>
			<p>New to the Blackbaud platform, MD Anderson partnered with Charity Dynamics to implement Blackbaud Luminate Online as well as design and develop their new walk website. Working strategically with the MD Anderson, we 	discussed walk goals, branding standards, and what an optimal user experience would be online for their supporters. Charity Dynamics dug in and worked diligently to implement the software as well as designed and developed an incredible user experience.</p>
			<p>The walk will wind around the MD Anderson campus and through the Texas Medical Center on November 12, 2016. Everyone who attends is encouraged to wear their favorite pair of boots to “give cancer the boot”.</p>
