			<p>Uruk is a Texas-based black metal troupe dedicated to nihilistic warfare waged in inhuman realms. Prior to the release of their debut album, <i>Battle Hymns</i>, I gave their existing logo a design refresh to bring it up to speed with the direction the band was moving in.</p>
			<p>This was a little different than most logo projects since they already had a strong logo to begin with. The masterful Christophe Szpajdel had been comissioned by members of the band some years before and had provided a great design typical of his caliber. However, in 2015 the original logo was looking a little too "second wave" for how the band actually sounded. It also came across as too refined and well-mannered...not something you'd expect from a band of orcs, for example.</p>
			<p>My strategy for the refresh then was to preserve the basic shape and structure, and to simply give it a wilder, less caligraphic treatment. Organic, bulging shapes heaped upon by gross entanglements of sharp lines all work together to help the updated logo more acutely portray the threatening spectacle and feral will of marauders on the hunt.</p>
